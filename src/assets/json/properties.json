Small, rectangular windows let in plenty of light and have been added to the house in a mostly asymmetric way. The house is equipped with an old-fashioned kitchen and two bathrooms, it also has a small living room, three bedrooms, a grand dining area and a large storage room. The building is square shaped. The house is partially surrounded by glass overhanging panels on two sides. The second floor is bigger than the first, which creates a stylish overhang around half the house. This floor has a very different style than the floor below.",
